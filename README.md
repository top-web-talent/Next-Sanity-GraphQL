# Github Activity Generator

</div>

>disclaimer: I made this project with the aim of having fun and to learn to automate things using the Python language

hello, this is my second automation project which is making a github activity generator, using this script you can change and manipulate your github contribution timeline from arid to greenish:

## Before 😩👎

be lush and very green, you will look very active and consistent in contributing on Github:

## After 💪👍

## How to use?
1. Make sure in your Machine already installed Python 3 and Git
2. Make sure Git in in your Machine already configured with Github.
3. create an empty Github Repository can public or private, but I prefer you to make it private. do not initialize it.
4. Download the [main.py script](https://github.com/aliifam/github-activity-generator/archive/main.zip) and open the file in your text editor.
5. delete the file commit.txt
6. customize the script in main.py for configuration as you want in here:
```python
total_day = 366 #total days back
commit_frequency = 10 #commit time per day
repo_link = "https://github.com/aliifam/github-activity-generator.git"
```
7. after the script is already, you just run the script and see the magic.
8. the script will make a new commit.txt file and make very many commit as you want after the process finished the script will push the repository to GitHub.
9. after all the process is successful, please press the star for this repository😊.
